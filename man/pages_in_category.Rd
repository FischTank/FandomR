\description{
wiki_catpages retrieves a list of pages, subcategories, files or all of the above
in a specified category (or series of specified categories)
}
\section{warnings}{

Because of the way MediaWiki stores this data, both "the category you asked for doesn't exist"
and "the category you asked for exists, but has no members" return in the same way.
}
\seealso{
\code{\link{categories_in_page}} for finding categories that a specified page is a member of.
